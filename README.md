# CellRegMap

Cellular Regulatory Map (CellRegMap) is a linear mixed model approach to test for and characterize context-specific eQTL variants across several cell contexts and states.
CellRegMap leverages single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, and does not require discretization of cells into cell groups.
CellRegMap builds on [StructLMM](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0271-0) but importantly now accounting for sample structure, including population structure and repeated observations for the same samples, e.g., multiple cells for the same donor.

The CellRegMap model and its applications to both real and simulated data are described in the [CellRegMap manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.01.458524v1).  

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/limix/CellRegMap/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/limix/CellRegMap/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
